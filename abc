I am trying to get a hang over VS Code here and maybe this can be some kind of step through guide, repo tutorial or gist file or something.

Step 1, the boring stuff, make an account and launch a codespace.

Step 2... to try to make this work as simple and fast as possible, you should consider what settings are most important to get going.
