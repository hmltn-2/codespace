# This is meant to be somewhere between a gist and a tutorial to help you set up VS Code really nicely on an iPhone, on top of GitHub Codespaces, so you can have a virtually free, highly usable, and very powerful mobile development environment everywhere you go. I really do feel that modern tools coming out right now are ushering in an era where programming may become as ubiquitous as writing or speaking, because it's so easy, fun, AI-assisted, useful, and user-friendly.

## First things first

There are honestly so many different ways and things you can do to cushion your editor experience that it can come across as daunting, complex and for experts. But on tje contrary, we will try to place things in an order so that each easy step enables so much more ease and understanding for the next ones and you can grow smoothly.

### The boring stuff

This stuff is so trivial I should barely even have to mention it, but technically, you will need this to get started, and it will be helpful to someone who has absolutely no idea how any of this works because they are new to this.

1. You will need some kind of computer (including a smartphone) with an internet connection (duh).
2. You will probably need an email address, cell phone, address, and credit card number (it helps to have this organized beforehand.)
3. Luckily, beyond that, all you will need to truly get started is a GitHub account.

> Luckily for us, GitHub is a very good-quality, premiere-grade service which offers robust and usable features often nearly or totally for free. After years of exploring, it is hard to imagine any company currently making it easier to become a programmer, even with little to no experience or guidance whatsoever.

# Setting up your codespace

I only sketch here pretty briefly:

a) The only potential small hiccup or inhibitor to your understanding may be, is there a central home place to get started with a Codespace? Yes, it is https://github.com/codespaces; or to be found by going to the github.com home page and looking for "Codespaces" in the menu there.
b) You may be used to running an application and saving files within it; but Codespaces actually requires you to at least have a "repository" (the foundation of a project) before you open a Codespace (hereuntoforth referred to as a "codespace") from it. Like me, you may find this counterintuitive at first, but just remember that if you ever want to open a new codespace, just make a new repository on your GitHub, and then go to the Codespaces menu to launch it as a codespace.

# The first real hurdle

Everything above is preliminary. From here we face the first more significant impediment, to being able to develop, comfortably and effectively, on a smartphone. It is merely this:

Because smartphone coding is a growing but nascent field, even industry-leading products are often not perfectly tailored to be optimal for a mobile experience. Luckily for us, GitHub Codespaces and VS Code (the editor we will use) *are* in fact so versatile, so robust, so effective and reliable, and so flexible that we can in fact quite easily set them up to be powerful tools from a smartphone - but you'll probably just need a little leg up to get started, if you've never used them before. **Hence this guide.**
