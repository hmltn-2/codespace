# Setting up a GitHub Codespace with VS Code on an iPhone

This tutorial will guide you through setting up an excellent configuration for developing with GitHub Codespaces and VS Code on an iPhone, even if you have never or barely developed before.

### Prerequisites

- A computer or smartphone with an internet connection
- An email address, cell phone, address, and credit card number (to set up a GitHub account)
 -A GitHub account

### Setting up your Codespace

1. Go to https://github.com/codespaces or find the Codespaces option in the menu on the GitHub home page.
2. Create a new repository on your GitHub account.
3. Launch the repository as a Codespace from the Codespaces menu.

# Setting up VS Code for iPhone development

By default, VS Code is not configured for development on an iPhone. However, it is possible to set it up for a more comfortable and efficient experience. The easiest way to do this is to add a configuration file to your repository that will set up VS Code for you.

### Configuration file

The configuration file installs the GitHub Copilot extension and sets it as the active extension for all files in the codespace. It also remaps the most important VS Code commands to the following keybindings for an iPhone keyboard:

- Show all commands: ´Shift + Space + P´
- Select all: ´Shift + Space + A´
- Show keyboard shortcuts: ´Shift + Space + K´
- Close current editor: ´Shift + Space + W´
- Create new file: ´Shift + Space + N´

With these keybindings, you should be able to easily navigate and use VS Code on your iPhone.
