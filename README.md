# 🔥 Setting up a 🦄 GitHub Codespace 🌀 with 💻 VS Code 💻 on an 📱 iPhone 📱

## 🌟 Introduction 🌟

This tutorial aims to 🌀 guide 🗺 users through 🔧 setting up an 🔝 optimal configuration 🔧 for 💻 developing 💻 with 🌟 GitHub Codespaces 🌟 and 💻 VS Code 💻 on an 📱 iPhone 📱. It is 📝 designed 📝 for users who may have 🔝 little or no prior development experience 🔝.

## 🚀 Getting Started 🚀

Before getting started, you will need to 🔍 ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- A computer or smartphone with an internet connection 🌐
- An email address, cell phone, address, and credit card number (to set up a GitHub account) 📧📱🏠💳
- A GitHub account 🆔

To set up your Codespace:

1. Go to https://github.com/codespaces or find the Codespaces option in the menu on the GitHub home page 🌐.
2. 🆕 Create a new repository on your GitHub account 🆕.
3. 🚀 Launch the repository as a Codespace from the Codespaces menu 🚀.

## 🔧 Setting up 💻 VS Code 💻 for iPhone development 📱

By default, 💻 VS Code 💻 is not configured for development on an 📱 iPhone 📱. However, it is possible to set it up for a more comfortable and efficient experience 💪. The easiest way to do this is to 🆕 add a configuration file 🆕 to your repository that will set up 💻 VS Code 💻 for you 🙏.

## 📄 Configuration file 📄

The configuration file installs the 🌟 GitHub Copilot 🌟 extension and sets it as the active extension for all files in the codespace 🖥️. It also remaps the most important 💻 VS Code 💻 commands to the following keybindings for an 📱 iPhone 📱 keyboard:

- Show all commands: `Shift + Space + P` 🔑
- Select all: `Shift + Space + A` 🔑
- Show keyboard shortcuts: `Shift + Space + K` 🔑
- Close current editor: `Shift + Space + W` 🔑
- Create new file: `Shift + Space + N` 🔑

With these keybindings, you should be able to easily 💪 navigate and use 💻 VS Code 💻 on your 📱 iPhone 📱.

## 🔨 Usage 🔨

To use your configured Codespace and 💻 VS Code 💻 on your 📱 iPhone 📱, follow the steps outlined in the "Getting Started" and "Setting up 💻 VS Code 💻 for iPhone development" sections 📝.
